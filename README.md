Collab is the interpreter that we'll be using to run code online. Alternatively, you can use spyder as the interpreter.

To Do:
	l Find data:
		○ To get started, about 30 data points, a couple variables
		○  By the end, preferably around hundreds or thousands data points and 5-6 variables
	l Get familiar with different types of data
		○ Conceptual understanding of visuals: here and here
		○ The codes are there for you to use
Matplot codes are the most stable
